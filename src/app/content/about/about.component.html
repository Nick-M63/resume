      With a background as a senior actuarial calculator, I made a successful transition into
      front-end development and have worked professionally in this field for several years. I enjoy
      combining my analytical mindset with creativity to build intuitive, well-designed user
      interfaces.

      I like turning functional requirements into clear and practical solutions, always with
      attention to usability and code quality. I'm naturally curious, enjoy thinking along about
      improvements, and value collaboration. Working together with colleagues toward a shared goal
      is where I do my best work.
